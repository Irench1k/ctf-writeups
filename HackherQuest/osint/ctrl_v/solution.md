We are given a short alphanumeric string 4c1xZwKP and tasked with finding the city where a "friend" is currently located.

## Solution

The string 4c1xZwKP is a Pastebin ID. Navigating to https://pastebin.com/4c1xZwKP reveals a message:

```
Please find me: Much-Explanation4796
```

The name Much-Explanation4796 follows the standard Reddit naming convention. Searching for this user on Reddit leads to the profile u/Much-Explanation4796, which contains a post with a photo of a street.

The landmark is the Spire of Dublin (also known as the Monument of Light) located on O'Connell Street. The presence of the Luas tracks and the specific green Dublin Bus confirms the location is the capital of Ireland.

Flag: FLAG{Dublin}

I hope this helps, have a nice day :)
